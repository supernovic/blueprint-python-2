==================

Blueprint Coding Challenge, Python Proj 2

Java/Python 2: Build a system that takes in a list of employees, their schedules, and number of hours required to work. Output a possible work schedule, if there exists one. You may assume anything you want (one person working at a time, only scheduling for one day), but the more realistic the better!

Run python scheduler.py test.txt for our test schedule
We can't identify impossible schedules, we can't move people around, we can't deal with collisions, but the sanity test works
